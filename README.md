# Artifact Keeper — Web

Next.js 16 web frontend for Artifact Keeper, an enterprise artifact registry.
Supports runtime-configurable sub-path deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **TypeScript 5.x**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for component primitives
- **TanStack Query 5** for server state management
- **Axios** for HTTP client
- **Lucide React** for icons

## Design Principles

Inspired by Apple HIG, Material Design 3, Linear, and Vercel Dashboard:

1. Dark mode first — developer tool default
2. Typography-driven hierarchy — minimal chrome
3. Generous whitespace — content breathes
4. Progressive disclosure — essentials first, details on demand
5. Motion with purpose — meaningful transitions

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on http://localhost:3000. Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to point to the Artifact Keeper backend.

## Deployment

### HTTPS hardening (`AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS`)

By default the web UI ships **without** HSTS and without the CSP
`upgrade-insecure-requests` directive so that a plain-HTTP deployment (e.g. the
first-run `http://<IP>:30080`) works out of the box. If those transport-security
headers were always emitted, the browser would rewrite every same-origin
request to `https://`, which a plain-HTTP port cannot answer — breaking the UI.

Set `AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS=true` (or `1`) when the UI is served behind TLS to
re-enable `Strict-Transport-Security` and `upgrade-insecure-requests`. All other
security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy,
Permissions-Policy, and the rest of the CSP) are always emitted regardless.

The flag is evaluated **at container runtime** — the headers are emitted by the
middleware (`src/middleware.ts`), which reads the env var on every request, so
no rebuild is needed. Set it on the running container:

```bash
docker run -e AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS=true ... artifact-keeper-web
```

or in the compose `environment:` block. The effective mode is logged once at
server startup (`[security] AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS ...`) so you can confirm the
container picked it up.

For custom image builds, `--build-arg AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS=true` still works — it
only sets the image's **default** value, which a runtime `-e` flag overrides.

### CSRF protection

The UI authenticates with httpOnly session cookies (`credentials: "include"`),
so it relies on a CSRF contract with the backend:

- **Frontend (implemented here):** every API request — SDK calls, `apiFetch`,
  and the remaining raw `fetch` mutations — carries the custom header
  `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` (see `CSRF_HEADER_NAME` in
  `src/lib/sdk-client.ts`). Cross-site HTML forms cannot set custom headers,
  so this header forces a CORS preflight a forged request cannot satisfy.
- **Backend (contract):** the backend MUST
  1. issue the session cookie with `SameSite=Lax` or `SameSite=Strict`, and
  2. reject cookie-authenticated mutating requests (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
     that lack the `X-Requested-With` header. Native package-manager clients
     are unaffected — they authenticate with Basic/Bearer credentials, not
     cookies, so the header requirement applies only to cookie auth.

The backend enforcement half is tracked as a follow-up issue in the
`artifact-keeper` repository (see issue #673 here for the full audit finding).

### Sub-path deployment (`BASE_PATH`)

The UI can be served under a configurable sub-path (e.g.,
`https://example.com/artifact-keeper/`) without rebuilding the Docker
image. **API routes stay at the root** (`/api/`, `/health`, native
package format paths) so the reverse proxy can route them directly to
the backend.

The mechanism uses a build-time placeholder (`/__AK_BASE_PATH__`) that
an entrypoint script replaces with the runtime `BASE_PATH` env var:

```bash
# Run at root (default)
docker run -p 3000:3000 artifact-keeper-web
# → UI at http://localhost:3000/

# Run at a sub-path
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e BASE_PATH=/ak artifact-keeper-web
# → UI at http://localhost:3000/ak/
```

**Required reverse proxy layout:**

```
https://example.com
  /ak/*        →  proxy  →  Next.js container (UI)
  /api/*       →  proxy  →  backend container (API)
  /health      →  proxy  →  backend container
  /v2/*        →  proxy  →  backend container  (Docker Registry)
  …
```

**Dev mode** (without Docker) — set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` directly:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/ak npm run dev
```

**SSO note:** When `BASE_PATH` is set, configure the backend's OAuth
redirect URI to include the sub-path (e.g.,
`https://example.com/ak/auth/callback`) so the SSO callback reaches
Next.js after authentication.
